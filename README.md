# Model-View-Delegate Qt Example

This project is a simple Qt Quick application demonstrating the **Model–View–Delegate** pattern using QML and C++.

It includes:

-   `Main.qml` as the main UI entry point
-   `LiveLocationModel.qml` and `LiveWeatherModel.qml` providing live data models
-   `OpenMeteo.qml` and `Requester.qml` for HTTP / API access
-   `main.cpp` and `CMakeLists.txt` for the C++/CMake application entry and build configuration

## Prerequisites

-   Qt 6 (tested with Qt 6.10 on macOS)
-   CMake (3.24+ recommended)
-   A C++17-capable compiler

Ensure Qt is available in your environment, typically via **Qt Creator** kits or `qt-cmake` on the command line.

## Configure and Build

From the project root (this directory):

```bash
# Configure (out-of-source build is recommended, but this project
# currently has a `build/` directory already configured by Qt Creator.)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/Qt/6.x/macos"

# Build
cmake --build build
```

On macOS with Qt installed via Qt Online Installer, a typical prefix path looks like:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/Qt/6.10.0/macos"
```

If you use **Qt Creator**, you can simply open this folder as a CMake project and press _Configure_ then _Run_.

## Run the App

After a successful build, run the application binary:

```bash
./build/appModelViewDelegate.app/Contents/MacOS/appModelViewDelegate
```

(Exact path/name may vary depending on your CMake configuration and build type.)

## Project Structure (excerpt)

-   `CMakeLists.txt` – CMake project configuration
-   `main.cpp` – C++ application entry point
-   `Main.qml` – main QML file
-   `LiveLocationModel.qml` – location model
-   `LiveWeatherModel.qml` – weather model
-   `OpenMeteo.qml` – API wrapper for weather data
-   `Requester.qml` – reusable HTTP requester component
-   `assets/` – icons, images, and other static resources
-   `build/` – CMake build output (autogenerated)

## Notes

-   This repository is mainly for learning and experimenting with the Qt Model–View–Delegate pattern using QML.
-   You can explore the QML files to see how models, views, and delegates interact to present live data.
